This is a template I use to create bare metal projects for the SAMD21 (SAMD21G18A) with VSCode

I have tested this with the Adafruit Metro Express, and Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21(Seeeduino XIAO).

I am in no way an expert with this, so use this at your own risk. 

You will need to change the following:

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
ASF_ROOT_PATH

To match you system.

You may also have to change a few other things if you're not using a mac. 

This might not even work for you, idk.

If it doesnt work for you, let me know, and I will try to help you out. 


A few other notes:

I am using VS Code on Mac
I am not using PlatformIO
This project does not use arduino libraries

Requirments:
Microchip ASF
ARM GNU Toolchain
Ninja - https://ninja-build.org/
Cmake
Maybe some other things, who knows.
